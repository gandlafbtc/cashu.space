# Cashu projects

## Cashu Python
[Cashu Python](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu) is the reference implementation. It is the [first](https://twitter.com/callebtc/status/1569986110272540674) Cashu wallet and mint. Both, the mint and the wallet can be used as standalone software or included into other applications as a library. It has full Bitcoin Lightning integration, PostgreSQL and SQLite database support, builtin Tor for hiding IPs for wallet and mint interactions, supports multiple mints, and can send and receive tokens on nostr, and supports pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) tokens.

## Cashu Feni
[Cashu Feni](https://github.com/cashubtc/cashu-feni) is a Cashu wallet and mint written in Golang. It supports multiple mints, P2SH, and offers Docker images for easy deployment. Cashu Feni is suited for high-performance applications.

## Cashu on LNbits
